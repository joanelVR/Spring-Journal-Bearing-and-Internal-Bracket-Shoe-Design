# Spring-Journal-Bearing-and-Internal-Brake-Shoe-Design
##### For the first part of this project, a helical compression spring was designed in order to act as a return mechanism operating at {X} hz with a deflection of {Y} inches.

##### For the second part of this project, a journal bearing and brake for a hollow drum assembly was designed in order to determine the necessary oil flow rate, side flow, maximum film pressure and the horsepower lost for the Journal Bearing.

##### For the third part of this project, an internal brake shoe needed to be decined. The drum had to come to stop between 15 and 45 seconds. When estimating the weight of the braket shoe, the assumption was that the brake shoe is fabricated of steel.
